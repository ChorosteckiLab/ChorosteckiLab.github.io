The main aim of our lab is to understand RNA biology, by using computational strategies. By combining computational approaches, high-throughput structure probing techniques and molecular biology experiments, my lab is expected to create a wealth of original information by unravelling novel, unexpected functions for RNAs from different species.

We are interested in: 
<ul>
  <li>Investigating the relationship between RNA structure and function, considering the RNA structure dynamics.</li>
  <li>Understanding the evolution of non-coding RNAs from different species.</li>
  <li>Integrating multi-omics approaches for therapeutic targeting of non-coding RNAs in Cancer.</li>
</ul>
