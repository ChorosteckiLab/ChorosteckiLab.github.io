Precise folding of RNA into complex structures is crucial for the RNA to perform complex biological functions such as those associated with translation, regulation of gene expression, and mRNA turnover. 
Many sequences, including mRNAs, riboswitches and lncRNAs, are expected to fold into <b> various competing structures that can co-exist</b>. 
Several methods have recently been developed to assess this structural diversity that allows the study of <b>alternative conformations of RNA</b> using experimental data. 

In this project, we will investigate the <b>relationship between RNA structure and function</b>, considering the RNA structure dynamics.
